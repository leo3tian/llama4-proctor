## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS 13.0+ (for student client)
- Node.js 18+ (for teacher dashboard)
- MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB instance

### Student Client Setup
1. **Configure MongoDB connection:**
   ```bash
   cd LlamaStudentClient
   cp Config.template.swift LlamaProctor/Config.swift
   # Edit Config.swift with your MongoDB connection string
   ```

2. **Build and run:**
   - Open `LlamaProctor.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Build and run the project (‚åò+R)
   - Grant screen recording permissions when prompted

### Teacher Dashboard Setup
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd teacher
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file with:
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   LLAMA_API_KEY=your_llama_api_key
   ```

3. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Database Setup
Create the following collections in MongoDB:
- `LlamaProctorDB.students` - Student activity data
- `LlamaProctorDB.assignments` - Teacher assignments
- `LlamaProctorDB.messages` - Student-teacher messages

## üìä Data Flow

1. **Assignment Creation**: Teachers set assignments through the web dashboard
2. **Assignment Sync**: Student apps retrieve assignments every 5 seconds
3. **Screen Capture**: Student apps capture screenshots every 10 seconds
4. **AI Analysis**: Screenshots analyzed by Llama AI for activity assessment
5. **Data Storage**: Analysis results stored in MongoDB with focus scores
6. **Teacher Updates**: Dashboard displays real-time student activity and insights

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: Screenshots analyzed via API, not stored permanently on devices
